# Brown-Bag
A collection of scripts for performing various group troubleshooting exercises.

Spin up a RHEL/CentOS 6 server with the 'rhel6_troubleshooting' from the cloud-init repo. This will automatically clone this repo onto the new server.
Complete your environment by running the scripts in the /root/brown-bag/scripts directory. Once the environment is setup run the scripts for each scenario respectively.
Enjoy!
