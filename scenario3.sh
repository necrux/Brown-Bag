#I run a website with GoDaddy at http://__DOMAIN__.com but I am looking to migrate to Rackspace. I have set up a subdomain at http://rackspace.__DOMAIN__.com to test before changing DNS but MySQL is not working correctly. I have ensured that mysql-server is installed and I have also imported all of the data into the ‘rackspace’ database. Please see if you can determine the problem. Thanks.
